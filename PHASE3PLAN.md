ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 â€“ Customer Portal: Shopping Cart & Orders
Step 1: Cart Service with BehaviorSubject

Create cart.service.ts inside shared/services/

Use BehaviorSubject<CartItem[]> to store cart state

Expose cart$ observable so components can subscribe

Add methods:

addToCart(product: Product)

removeFromCart(productId: number)

clearCart()

getTotal()

Step 2: Add to Cart Button & Cart Summary

In Product List / Product Detail Component â†’ add "Add to Cart" button

In Header Component â†’ add Cart Icon with item count

Create a Cart Summary Component to show selected products and total price

Step 3: Checkout Form (Reactive Forms)

Create checkout.component.ts

Use Reactive Forms with fields:

Name

Address

Phone

Payment method (COD, Card)

On submit â†’ prepare order object (cart items + user details)

Step 4: Save Orders in Backend

Create order.service.ts

Call backend /orders endpoint with order payload

Clear cart after successful order placement

Step 5: Order History Page

Create order-history.component.ts

Fetch orders from backend (/orders?userId=xxx)

Display in table (Date, Items, Amount, Status)

Angular Features Highlighted

âœ… State Management: Services + RxJS (BehaviorSubject)

âœ… Reactive Forms: Checkout form

âœ… Observables + AsyncPipe: For cart + orders

âœ… Routing: cart, checkout, orders

ðŸ‘‰ Suggestion: We should start with Step 1 (Cart Service + Model) since itâ€™s the backbone.

Do you want me to write the Cart model + CartService code first?

`ng g interface shared/models/cart-item --type=model`
`ng g interface shared/models/product --type=model`
